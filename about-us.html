      <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
      <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise
        routine.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Burpee</dt>
        <dd>Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength and endurance.
          Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back
          and then forward again
          quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position. </dd>
        <dt>Plank</dt>
        <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up position and rest your
          forearms on the floor.
          Hold the position as long as you can. </dd>
        <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
        <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push-up position,
          bring one knee up to
          your chest, and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
